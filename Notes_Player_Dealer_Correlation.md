Summary of Findings:

	- On the dates of 03/10, 03/12, and 03/15, a total of 13 losses occurred
	- These losses took place at the same times on each of the specified days
		03/10: 5 AM, 8 AM, 2 PM, 8 PM, 11 PM
		03/12: 5 AM, 8 AM, 2 PM, 8 PM, 11 PM
		03/15: 5 AM, 8 AM, 2 PM
	- There was one player who was playing roulette at each of the above dates and times; Mylie Schmidt
	- The roulette dealer working at each of the above dates and times was Billy Jones

In conclusion, the player Mylie Schmidt is working together with the dealer Billy Jones to scam Lucky Duck Casino.  Mylie Schmidt was playing and Billy Jones was working during each of the 13 incidents of loss over the course of three days.  
That is far beyond the realm of coincidence, and reeks of collusion.  Please see the Roulette_Losses and Dealers_working_during_losses files for more detailed information.
